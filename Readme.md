# Photo-z Working group repository

Welcome!

- Please feel free to add code, documentation in folders ideally.     

- It is a good practice to work in branches and do pull-request to keep things organized. 

- See production sub folder for information on what is needed to release a catalogue to the colaboration

- Inside each directory should be a readme descibing the directory contents. If there isn't please add one, or bug people until one appears.

The current directory list look like:

simulations  
-- codes to enable 'almost' hands-free redshifting of simulated data  


useful_tools     
-- codes which are useful and either don't fit nicely into any one, or span multiple, directories.


weights
-- Codes to calculate color space reweighting 


notebook         
-- example juypter notebooks to either provide tips on how to run code, or scripts to visualise the outputs


redshift_codes   
-- a general, modular framework to train and test redshift codes. Please add your codes here, and adopt the standardised redshift interfaces.


systematic_tests 
-- codes to peform systematic tests of the redshift predictions


validation
-- the home of the photo-z validation pipeline
