This file describes the ipython notebooks found in this directory.

========================
To start the notebook
========================
From the terminal, navigate to this directory. At the command line type:

%>ipython notebook

=========
If it's not installed yet, either install it:
http://ipython.org/notebook.html

Or better yet, get a nice python distribution [free for academics] 
https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/
[or https://www.continuum.io/downloads]

If you every have any python issues, just install this distribution and they will go away forever!

=========================
--- UnderstandingTheValidationScriptFile.ipynb 
This script loads the output [.p] pickle files of the validation/photoz_metrics.py script, which is run to measure sets of metrics on redshift predictions.
It then makes nice plots of various useful metrics from the [.p] pickle files.


------ValidationScriptExample.ipynb                     
This script describes in some detail the inner workings of the validation/photoz_metrics.py script. We also show how fast it is.


------ Example_knnweights.ipynb     
This script give a tutorial on the knn_lima et al weighting scheme that has been converted to python only, and callable from within a python script.

----- Validation_example.ipynb                          


----- Visualise_systematics_1d_correlation_output.ipynb 
This script loads the output yaml files generated by systematic_tests/one_d_correlate.py [which measures a one-d correlation between all columns in a fits file]. It makes 'covariance matrix' type plots to show the strength of the correlation (including non-linear correlations) between each field and every other field.


------ write_hdf5_in_batches.ipynb


--- sample_from_pdf.ipynb
This script shows how to sample a random point from a pdf.


--------- Validation_metric_values_resampled_data.ipynb
This script reads in the validation file output from the ReSampled Alhambra data, and determines the metric values and errors, and also adds the error component from Cosmic variance.


--------- Validation_metric_values_resampled_datav1.ipynb
This script reads in the validation file output from singular Dec ReSampled COSMOS data file, and determines the metric values and errors, and also adds the error component from Cosmic variance.
