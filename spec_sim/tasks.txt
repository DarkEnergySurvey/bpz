- get sky files for VIMOS MR, transmission corrected
- *** find out star fraction in the main surveys (VVDS, zCOS, VIPERS) - WH - DONE
- construct the parent samples
  - run sim spec
- *** write code to construct the test subsamples (300 obj. per file, about 50 fiels in total - with overlap (10% of samples should be in two different files).
  - construct subsamples, send to ozdes
- refine s/n code - the scaling relation is rather rough.
- write ML algo (random forest)
- remove spectroscopic duplicates
- generalise the routines to all surveys, removing hard-coded file names (where appropriate).
- tidy up code
